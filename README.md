# Spam Detection Project

## Description
A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This model is built using Python and various data science libraries to analyze text data and make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "SPAM text message 20170820 - Data.csv" file, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if you used them)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter`).
3. Open and run the `Spam Dection.ipynb` notebook to see the model training and evaluation process.
4. The file `spam_model.joblib` is the pre-trained model.
