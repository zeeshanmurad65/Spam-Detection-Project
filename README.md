# Spam Detection Project

## Description
A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This model is built using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess text data and Scikit-learn to train a classification model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "SPAM text message 20170820 - Data.csv" file, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF Vectorizer and model training)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter`).
3. Open and run the `Spam Dection.ipynb` notebook to see the data preprocessing, NLP feature extraction, and model training process.
4. The file `spam_model.joblib` is the pre-trained model.
